Notes to myself while working though
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/examples_and_tutorials/tutorial02_multiapps/index.html

5/2/2023T
I read the tutorial, and it looks to me like I will need to learn about the moose objects
that the MultiApp blocks are using.
I think the idea is to build directly from the .i files in the tutorials folder of my moose clone,
and I may be able to pick up more info in the test/tests and framework/src folders.

The kernels are documented:
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/Diffusion.html
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/TimeDerivative.html
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/kernels/BodyForce.html
The documents cross reference all the modules, tutorials and tests where they are used.

The instructions are
  Run 01_parent.i
    Look at the order of execution
    Inspect outputs
    Modify execute_on to see what happens

I have activated my moose virtual environment in one terminal window.

I decided to run 01_sub.i directly first:

I have another terminal window where I have activated my peacock virtual environment/
(peacock) rogerfrye@Rogers-Laptop step01_multiapps % ../../../python/peacock/peacock -r 01_sub_out.e
Only the v variable is available in a 3 step video.
Final step shows the usual horizontal diffusion rainbow cold to hot.
on a 10x10 grid from 0.0 to 1.0 because those are the boundary conditions.

Back in the moose tutorial terminal:

 As expected the parent and sub interleave.

Peacock on 01_parent_out.e shows u variable on 10x10 grid from 0.0 to 1.0
but the horizontal diffusion is cold on edges and hot in center,
because the BCs are 0 on the edges, and parent has a BodyForce kernel of 1.

peacock -r 01_parent_out_sub_app0.e shows only blue. Don't know why???

Instructions say: Modify execute_on to see what happens.
I don't know how to do that. Looked in 
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/source/interfaces/SetupInterface.html
I tried, but failed with
% time ../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 01_parent.i Executioner/execute_on=final
*** ERROR ***
CLI_ARGS:1: unused parameter 'Executioner/execute_on'

% time ../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 02_parent_sublimit.i
As expected, it runs both at dt = 0.2 because sub has smaller timestep.

% time ../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 03_parent_subcycle.i
As expected it runs 5 subs for each parent.

Peacock on parent shows 10 timesteps with increasing definition.
Peacock on sub shows 10 timesteps with increasingly defined rainbow.

../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 03_parent_subcycle.i  0.16s user 0.04s system 97% cpu 0.213 total
I don't want to modify one of the dt values in the .i file, and I don't know how to select on command line.
so skip that experiment.

Run 04_parent_multiple.i which has
[MultiApps]
  [sub_app]
    type = TransientMultiApp
    positions   = '0 0 0  1 0 0  2 0 0'
#    positions_file = 04_positions.txt
    input_files = '04_sub1_multiple.i'
#    input_files = '04_sub1_multiple.i  04_sub2_multiple.i 04_sub3_multiple.i'
#    output_in_position = true
  []
[]

% time ../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 04_parent_multiple.i
04_sub1_multiple.i is used for all 3 sub_app positions.
It runs sub_app0, sub_app1, sub_app2, parent and repeats for Time Step2

Peacock on parent shows time 0, 1, 2 with increasing definition.
The 3 subs look identical. I don't understand what positions do. Maybe virtual identifiers?

Modify 04_parent_multiple.i to use 3 different sub files with right BCs 1, 2, 3.
The run log seems the same as before.
../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 04_parent_multiple.i  0.18s user 0.04s system 97% cpu 0.225 total
Peacock shows the sub files with Max 1, 2, 3.

Uncomment output_in_position.
The run log seems the same as before.
../../../test/moose_test-opt -i 04_parent_multiple.i  0.18s user 0.04s system 97% cpu 0.224 total
I don't see any difference in peacock.
I would think the offsets are in a 3r dimension, but looking at 2D. I don't get it????
